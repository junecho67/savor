# Savor: AI-Enabled Workflow Prototype
**Bridging Generational Gaps via System-Level Design**

This is a functional **React prototype** developed to pressure-test the interaction logic and system-level behaviors of *Savor*, an intergenerational recipe-sharing app originally designed during the **Rice Design-a-thon 2026**.

## 🚀 Goals
The goal of this technical iteration was to move beyond static Figma mockups and explore **AI-enabled workflows**. Using an AI-native development environment allowed me to identify and resolve **experience quality gaps** in the "AI-human handoff" within the app's core flows.

## 🛠 Tech Tools
* **Framework:** React + Tailwind CSS
* **Editor:** [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) (AI-Native IDE)
* **Design-to-Code Context:** Figma MCP (Model Context Protocol)

## 🧠 What I Validated...
- Refine Motion Choreography: Validated high-fidelity transitions, such as contextual slide-up features, to ensure navigation feels intentional and smooth for users
- Prototype System-Integrated Workflows: Simulated the logic of native device permissions, such as connecting to a photo library, to assess the friction of the "create post" user journey.
- Validate Input Feedback Loops: Implemented real-time typing states and input interactions to test the responsiveness and clarity of the interface
- Bridge the Design-to-Code Gap: Leveraged Cursor and Figma MCP to assess the technical feasibility of these interactive patterns, identifying where systematic adjustments were needed for a cleaner engineering handoff.
