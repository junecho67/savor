# Savor
**Bridging Generational Gaps**

This is a functional **React prototype** developed to pressure-test the interaction logic and system-level behaviors of *Savor*, an intergenerational recipe-sharing app originally designed during the **Rice Design-a-thon 2026**.

## 🚀 Goals
The goal of this technical iteration was to move beyond static Figma mockups and explore AI-enabled workflows in a functional environment. More specifically, this project was an opportunity to learn and experiment with Cursor and AI-native development tools, while understanding how design decisions translate into working interaction logic.

## 🛠 Tech Tools
* **Framework:** React + Vite
* **Editor:** [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) (AI-Native IDE)
* **Design-to-Code Context:** Figma MCP (Model Context Protocol)

## 🔍 What I Explored...
*-Refined motion and transitions: Tested slide-up panels and screen transitions to make sure navigation felt smooth and intentional rather than abrupt or confusing.
*-Prototyped real system flows: Simulated native device behaviors (like photo library permissions) and added real-time typing states.
*-Closed the design-to-code gap: Used Cursor and Figma MCP to translate interaction ideas into working logic, spotting where designs needed to be simplified or adjusted for implementation.
